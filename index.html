    <h2>Party Platform</h2>
    <p>Below are 10 key issues and where your party stands on each. Keep each to 1–2 sentences.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Racial Inequality  – We believe everyone deserves equal opportunities and we must remove the economic and social barriers that limit them</li>
      <li>Gun Control – We believe in protecting the right to own firearms while ensuring responsible ownership through strong background checks and safety measures.</li>
      <li>Inflation- We believe in fighting Inflation. The Government should avoid access spending and take steps to lower the cost of living. </li>
      <li>Job Creation – We believe in growing the economy by supporting small businesses, investing in new industries, and providing workers with the skills they need for the future.</li>
      <li>Military Policy– We believe the United States should have a strong and ready military to defend our nation,but Military power should be used wisely. We believe in only using Military power when it is clearly needed to defend our country and people.</li>
      <li>International Trade – We believe in fair and balanced trade that supports American workers while strengthening relationships with our global partners.</li>
      <li>Education Policy – We believe every child deserves the opportunity for a high-quality education. Education decisions should involve the parents, and local communities while the federal government ensures equal opportunity. </li>
      <li>Healthcare – We believe everyone should have access to quality, affordable healthcare through a system that combines public and private options to meet people’s needs.</li>
      <li>Clean water – We believe access to clean water is a basic right. Protecting water quality should be a shared responsibility between local, state, and federal government.</li>
      <li>Data Privacy – We believe in protecting people’s personal information online while encouraging innovation and responsible use of technology by businesses and government.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Real-World Legislation Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Social Security Fairness Act of 2023 (Democratic)</strong> The Unity Party would support the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023 because it protects retirees and public servants by ensuring fair treatment and equal access to the benefits they have earned through years of service.</li>
      <li><strong>The Big Beautiful Bill (Republican)</strong> The Unity Party would respectfully oppose the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, arguing that while tax relief for hardworking families is important, the sweeping cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs undermine the unity and shared-responsibility values the party holds dear.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Campaign Strategy</h2>

    <h3>Fundraising Approach</h3>
    <p class="editable">The Unity Party’s fundraising approach focuses on transparency, community involvement, and small dollar donations that empower everyday Americans instead of large donors or special interests. Because our goal is to unite the country, we would encourage supporters from across the political spectrum including moderate Democrats, moderate Republicans, independents, and younger voters to contribute in ways that reflect shared responsibility. We would rely heavily on online crowdfunding platforms and social media apps such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and X to promote donation drives with short, positive, and engaging content. In addition, we would host local fundraisers, town halls, and community events to connect directly with voters and show how every contribution helps bring people together and strengthen unity.</p>

    <h3>Recruitment of Staff & Volunteers</h3>
    <p class="editable">The Unity Party’s approach to recruiting staff and volunteers focuses on inclusion, collaboration, and shared purpose. We would reach out to people who believe in bridging divides and want to make a positive difference in their communities. Recruitment would take place through community events, local organizations, colleges, and neighborhood gatherings to connect with people directly. We would also encourage current members and supporters to invite friends and family to join the effort. By creating a welcoming and supportive environment, the Unity Party would attract dedicated individuals who value teamwork, unity, and serving others while helping the party achieve its mission. We would provide training and mentorship to ensure volunteers and staff feel confident and effective in their roles. Recognizing and celebrating their contributions would be a key part of keeping people motivated and engaged over the long term.</p>

    <h3>Target Audience & Messaging</h3>
    <p class="editable">The Unity party's goals are to fight against political polarization and help Americans realize they have more beliefs in common than they think. The party wants to unify the American people. That's why the Unity parties' target audience is moderate voters. People who identify as moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans. The Unity party would most likely have the most success with younger voters. The party would also find success among the independents and the people who are unaffiliated with a party. The Unity party's target audience is people who value unity over division. They value equality, government spending discipline, local involvement, and shared government involvement.</p>

    <h3>Use of Media (TV, Social Media, etc.)</h3>
    <p class="editable"> As a big target audience of our party is younger voters, we would take advantage of social media. We would use platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and X. We would make short videos highlighting certain beliefs and core values, such as equality and unity. Also, taking advantage of and using traditional media such as TV and radio could be effective as well. We would have our leaders do interviews highlighting our beliefs and solutions to certain problems. One of the most important things would be to make sure we are spreading positivity as we are trying to fight against political polarization that is spread through the media.</p>
